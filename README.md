# Modeling the Distribution of Normal Data in Pre-Trained Deep Features for Anomaly Detection in PyTorch

PyTorch implementation of [Modeling the Distribution of Normal Data in Pre-Trained Deep Features for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14140).  

This paper presents an anomaly detection approach that consists of fitting a multivariate Gaussian to normal data in the pre-trained deep feature representations, using Mahalanobis distance as anomaly score.  
It is a simple yet effective approach and achieves SOTA on `MVTec AD` dataset.  

## Prerequisites
* python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.5+
* efficientnet_pytorch == 0.6.3
* sklearn, matplotlib

Install prerequisites with:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you already download [`MVTec AD`](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/) dataset, move a file to `data/mvtec_anomaly_detection.tar.xz`.  
If you don't have a dataset file, it will be automatically downloaded during the code running.

## Usage

To test this implementation code on `MVTec AD` dataset:
```
cd src
python main.py
```

After running the code above, you can see the ROCAUC results in `src/result/roc_curve_{model_name}.png`
